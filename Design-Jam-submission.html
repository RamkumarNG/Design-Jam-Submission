              <h5>2005–06: Senior and World Cup debuts</h5>
              <div class="image1"></div>
                <p id="para_for_icareer">
                    In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[322] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his "re-debut" ahead of the match.[323] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as "a jewel".He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.<br><br>
                    During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[327] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[328][329] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[332] Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.

                    After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.<br><br>
                    Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[354] His first hat-trick with the Albicelestes came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013; in addition to providing an assist, he scored twice from a penalty kick, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.

               <h5>2016–17: Third Copa América final, retirement, and return</h5>
              <div class="image3"></div>
                <p id="para_for_icareer">
                    Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;he was elected man of the match for his performance.
                    <br><br>
                    During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[385] He stated, "I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made."[386] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States."Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.

                <p id="para_for_icareer">
                    Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[397] On 1 September 2016, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.
                    <br><br>
                    On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.On 5 May 2017, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[401] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October 2017, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[402] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.

              <div class="image4"></div>
                <p id="para_for_icareer">
                    On 21 May 2019, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni's final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América.In Argentina's second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.Following Argentina's 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match.In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean.Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[426] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.
                    <br><br>
                    On 10 September 2020, Argentina FA announced that Messi's one match suspension was lifted and he would be available to play the qualifiers next month.On 18 September, Messi was called up to the Argentina squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Bolivia in October.

          <div id="elife">
            <h4 class="title_for_elife">Early life:</h4>
                  <p class="para_for_elife">Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in<span id="highlight"> Rosario</span>, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager,      and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of <span id="highlight">Italian</span> and<span id="highlight"> Spanish </span>descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, <span id="highlight">Maximiliano</span> and <span id="highlight">Emanuel Biancucchi</span>, both of whom became professional footballers.At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.<br><br>
                  A lifelong supporter of <span id="highlight">Newell's Old Boys</span>, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of <span id="highlight">"The Machine of '87"</span>, the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, <span id="highlight">Pablo Aimar</span>, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to Argentina's economic collapse.His goalscoring idol growing up was <span id="highlight">Ronaldo</span>, with Messi calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".<br><br>
                  As the Messi family had relatives in <span id="highlight">Catalonia</span>, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.In February 2001, the family relocated to <span id="highlight">Barcelona</span>, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to <span id="highlight">Rosario</span> with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.<br><br>
                  After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the <span id="highlight">Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF)</span> in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were <span id="highlight">Cesc Fàbregas</span> and <span id="highlight">Gerard Piqué</span>.After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,Messi became an integral part of the <span id="highlight">"Baby Dream Team"</span>, Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.At the close of the season, he received an offer to join <span id="highlight">Arsenal</span>, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.

              <div class="image6"></div>
                <p id="para_for_pl">
                    Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with <span id="highlight">Antonella Roccuzzo</span>, a fellow native of <span id="highlight">Rosario</span>.He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the <span id="highlight">Barcelona–Espanyol</span> derby.
                    <br><br>
                    Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons: <span id="highlight">Thiago</span> (born 2012), <span id="highlight">Mateo</span> (born 2015) and <span id="highlight">Ciro</span> (born 2018). To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with Messi attending the birth after being given permission by Barcelona to miss training. He announced his son's arrival on his Facebook page, writing, <span id="highlight">"Today I am the happiest man in the world, my son was born and thanks to God for this gift!"</span>Thiago's name and handprints are tattooed on his left calf.In April 2015, Messi confirmed on Facebook that they were expecting another child.He missed training ahead of a match against Atlético Madrid to attend the birth of his second son, Mateo, on 11 September 2015 in Barcelona.On 30 June 2017, he <span id="highlight">married Roccuzzo</span> at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario with about 260 guests attending his wedding.On 15 October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child in an Instagram post, with the words <span id="highlight">"Family of 5"</span>.On 10 March 2018, Messi skipped the match against Málaga after Ciro was born.
                    <br><br>
                    Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, <span id="highlight">Celia</span>, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, <span id="highlight">Jorge</span>, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in <span id="highlight">Rosario</span>.
                    <br><br><span class="image7"></span>
                    Since leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of <span id="highlight">Rosario</span>, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in <span id="highlight">Buenos Aires</span>, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to <span id="highlight">Buenos Aires</span> the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of <span id="highlight">"The Machine of '87"</span> at Newell's Old Boys. He currently lives in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. Although considered a one-club man, he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.
                    <br><br>
                    According to a genealogical research conducted by <span id="highlight">Diari Segre</span> in 2011, Messi is a <span id="highlight">fourth cousin</span> of former teammate <span id="highlight">Bojan Krkić</span>.The finding had a very significant coverage in Spanish media: it was reported by all four major sports newspapers and by some of the largest general-interest newspapers, including <span id="highlight">ABC</span> and <span id="highlight">La Vanguardia</span>.
                </p>
                <h5>Philanthropy</h5>
                <p id="para_for_pl">
                    Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the <span id="highlight">United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)</span>, an organisation with which <span id="highlight">Barcelona</span> also have a strong association.[548][549] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in <span id="highlight">UNICEF</span> campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.<br><br>
                    <span class="image5"></span>
                    In addition to his work with <span id="highlight">UNICEF</span>, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the <span id="highlight">Leo Messi Foundation</span>, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in <span id="highlight">Boston</span>, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global <span id="highlight">"Messi and Friends"</span> football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with <span id="highlight">Adidas</span> as their main sponsor.<br><br>
                    Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at <span id="highlight">Newell's Old Boys</span> and rival club <span id="highlight">Rosario Central</span>, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against <span id="highlight">La Razón</span> newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.

              <h5>2003–05: Rise to the first team</h5>
              <div class="image8"></div>
                <p id="para_for_ccareer">
                    During the <span id="highlight">2003–04 season</span>, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the <span id="highlight">Juveniles A</span>, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team:<span id="highlight">"He destroyed us all...</span> They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."<br><br>
                    At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against <span id="highlight">José Mourinho's Porto</span> on 16 November 2003.His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.<span id="highlight">Ronaldinho</span> soon befriended Messi, whom he called <span id="highlight">"little brother"</span>, which greatly eased his transition into the first team.
                    <br><br>
                    During the <span id="highlight">2004–05 season</span>, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager <span id="highlight">Frank Rijkaard</span> to promote him.Since <span id="highlight">Ronaldinho</span> already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.As a substitute player, he played 77 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against <span id="highlight">Shakhtar Donetsk</span>.He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by <span id="highlight">Ronaldinho</span>, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.
                </p>
                <h5>2009–10: First Ballon d'Or</h5>
                <p id="para_for_ccareer">
                    His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.After victories in the <span id="highlight">Supercopa de España</span> and <span id="highlight">UEFA Super Cup</span> in August, Barcelona won the <span id="highlight">FIFA Club World Cup</span> against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.At 22 years old, Messi won the <span id="highlight">Ballon d'Or</span> and <span id="highlight">the FIFA World Player of the Year award</span>, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy's history.<br><br>
                    <span class="image9"></span>
                    Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with the club's summer acquisition <span id="highlight">Zlatan Ibrahimović</span> occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4–0 with two goals and an assist from Messi. At that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.He scored all of his side's four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsène Wenger's Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in the competition.Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Inter Milan, Messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year.[104] As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a <span id="highlight">second consecutive La Liga trophy</span> with only a single defeat and earned his <span id="highlight">first European Golden Shoe</span>.
                </p>
                <h5>2012: A record-breaking year</h5>
                <p id="para_for_ccareer">
                    As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against <span id="highlight">Bayer Leverkusen</span>, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after <span id="highlight">Gerd Müller</span> to be top scorer in four campaigns.Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the <span id="highlight">top goalscorer</span> in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of <span id="highlight">César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick</span> against Granada.<br><br>
                    <span class="image10"></span> 
                    Under manager <span id="highlight">Tito Vilanova</span>, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway point, a record in Spanish football.A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez's record of 190 league goals, becoming <span id="highlight">Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga</span>, and <span id="highlight">Gerd Müller's record</span> of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany.[142] Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed "with respect and admiration", after breaking his 40-year record.[143] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[144] Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year.[145][146] As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the <span id="highlight">FIFA Ballon d'Or</span>, becoming the only player in history to win the <span id="highlight">Ballon d'Or four times</span>.
                </p>
                <h5>2016–17: Fourth Golden Boot</h5>h5>
                <p id="para_for_ccareer">
                    Messi opened the <span id="highlight">2016–17 season</span> by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona's captain in the absence of the injured <span id="highlight">Andrés Iniesta</span>;he set-up Munir's goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August,and subsequently scored and assisted in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August.Three days later, he scored two goals and provided an assist to lead Barcelona to a 6–2 victory against Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season.On 13 September 2016, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 7–0 victory; this was also Messi's sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player. A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1–1 draw against Atlético Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks.[214] He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña, on 16 October.[215] Three days after this, he netted his <span id="highlight">thirty-seventh club hat-trick</span> as Barcelona defeated <span id="highlight">Manchester City</span> 4–0.On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona's 3–1 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by <span id="highlight">Raúl</span>.<br><br>
                    <span class="image11"></span>
                    On 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's <span id="highlight">all-time top-scorer</span> from free-kicks.On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd.On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey Final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match.In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals and 16 assists, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the <span id="highlight">Pichichi</span> and <span id="highlight">European Golden Boot Awards</span> for the <span id="highlight">fourth time</span> in his career.

                <p id="para_for_ccareer">
                    Messi made his first appearance of the season on 17 September, and on 6 October he scored his first goal of the season with a free kick in a 4–0 home win over Sevilla; this was his 420th goal in La Liga, which saw him break Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 419 goals scored in Europe's top five leagues.On 23 October, Messi scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a 2–1 away win over Slavia Prague, becoming the first player to score in 15 consecutive Champions League seasons (excluding qualifying rounds).He also equalled Raúl and <span id="highlight">Cristiano Ronaldo's</span> shared record of the most sides scored against in the competition (33).On 29 October, Messi scored and assisted twice in a 5–1 home win over Real Valladolid in La Liga; his first goal – a set piece from 35 yards – was the 50th free-kick of his career.His goals (608) also saw him overtake Cristiano Ronaldo's senior goal tally (606) at club level.On 9 November, Messi scored three goals (including two free kicks) in a 4–1 home win against Celta Vigo.
